## What are Conversations?

**Conversations** are threaded chat sessions between [visitors](/docs/concepts) (or [contacts](/docs/concepts/contacts)) and your support team. Each conversation has a timeline of [items](/docs/concepts/timeline-items)—messages, events, and more.

## Key Properties

Every conversation includes:

- **status**: `open` or `resolved`
- **priority**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `urgent`
- **participants**: Support agents (human or AI) involved
- **tags**: Labels for categorization (billing, technical, onboarding, etc.)
- **timeline**: Ordered list of [timeline items](/docs/concepts/timeline-items)
- **lastTimelineItem**: Most recent activity for sorting/preview

## Conversation Lifecycle

### Creation

Conversations are created when:

- A visitor sends their first message through the support widget
- A support agent initiates a conversation from the dashboard
- Your backend creates one via the API

### Status Flow

```
open → resolved
  ↓       ↑
  └───────┘ (can be reopened)
```

- **open**: Active conversation requiring attention
- **resolved**: Conversation marked as complete (can be reopened)

### Priority Levels

Conversations can be prioritized:

- **low**: General questions, non-urgent feedback
- **medium**: Standard support requests (default)
- **high**: Important issues affecting user experience
- **urgent**: Critical problems requiring immediate attention

Support agents can adjust priority based on conversation context.

## Real-time Updates

Conversations support **real-time synchronization** via WebSocket:

- New messages appear instantly
- Typing indicators show when agents are composing
- Seen receipts track when messages are read
- Status changes broadcast immediately

The Cossistant SDK handles all WebSocket management automatically—no configuration needed.

## Conversation Timeline

Each conversation has a timeline of [items](/docs/concepts/timeline-items):

- **Messages**: Text and files from visitors or agents
- **Events**: System activities (assigned, resolved, participant joined)
- **Future items**: AI tool calls, interactive UI, custom actions

The timeline provides a complete audit trail of the conversation.

### Example Timeline

```
1. [MESSAGE] Visitor: "How do I reset my password?"
2. [EVENT] Agent Sarah joined the conversation
3. [MESSAGE] Sarah: "I can help! Click your profile..."
4. [EVENT] Conversation marked as resolved
5. [MESSAGE] Visitor: "Thanks, that worked!"
6. [EVENT] Conversation reopened
```

## Multi-Agent Support

Conversations can involve multiple participants:

- **Human agents**: Support team members
- **AI agents**: Automated assistants
- **Mixed mode**: AI handles initial triage, escalates to humans

Agents can:

- Join and leave conversations
- See full conversation history
- Add internal notes (private [timeline items](/docs/concepts/timeline-items))

## Tags and Organization

Tag conversations for filtering and reporting:

```typescript
tags: ["billing", "urgent", "enterprise-customer"];
```

Tags help:

- Route conversations to specialized teams
- Generate reports and analytics
- Filter dashboard views
- Track common issue types

## Seen Tracking

Cossistant tracks when participants last viewed a conversation:

- **Visitors**: Automatic seen updates when widget is open
- **Agents**: Tracked in dashboard
- **Unread count**: Calculated per participant

This powers unread badges in the support widget and dashboard.

## Cross-Device Continuity

For identified [contacts](/docs/concepts/contacts), conversations sync across devices:

- Start conversation on desktop
- Continue on mobile
- Same history, same context

Anonymous [visitors](/docs/concepts) have device-specific conversations.
