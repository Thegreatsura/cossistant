description: Complete guide for setting up Cossistant locally and contributing to the project.
---

Welcome to Cossistant! This guide will help you get the project running locally and understand how to contribute effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Desktop** - Required for running Postgres and Redis locally
- **Bun v1.2+** - Our package manager and runtime ([install Bun](https://bun.sh))
- **Git** - For version control

## Quick Start

Get up and running in three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cossistantcom/cossistant.git
cd cossistant
bun install --workspaces
bun dev
```

That's it! The `bun dev` command will:

1. Start Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis containers)
2. Start the API server with Upstash Workflow in local mode
3. Start the Next.js web application

<Callout type="info">
  **Upstash Workflow runs locally** - No account needed! When the server starts,
  you'll see the workflow credentials displayed in your console. These
  credentials don't change between restarts.
</Callout>

## What's Running

After `bun dev` completes, you'll have:

- **API Server**: `http://localhost:3001` (Hono + tRPC + WebSocket)
- **Web App**: `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js dashboard, docs, landing)
- **Postgres**: `localhost:5432` (via Docker)
- **Redis**: `localhost:6379` (via Docker)
- **Upstash Workflow**: Local mode (credentials in console)

## Database Setup

### Default Connection

The local database connection string is:

```
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cossistant
```

This is automatically configured when you run `bun dev`.

### Running Migrations

After starting the services for the first time, run the database migrations:

```bash
cd apps/api
bun db:migrate
```

### Seeding Data (Optional)

To populate the database with sample data for development:

```bash
cd apps/api
bun db:seed
```

### Making Schema Changes

When you need to modify the database schema:

1. Update the schema files in `apps/api/src/db/schema`
2. Generate a migration:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   bun db:generate
   ```
3. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   bun db:migrate
   ```

### Database Studio

To explore the database with Drizzle Studio:

```bash
cd apps/api
bun db:studio
```

## Optional: S3 Setup

S3 file storage is **only needed if you're testing file uploads**. For most development work, you can skip this.

If you do need S3:

1. Navigate to the infrastructure directory:
   ```bash
   cd infra/aws/s3-public-setup
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the [S3 Setup README](/infra/aws/s3-public-setup/README.md)
3. The Terraform configuration will create the necessary AWS resources

## Project Structure

### Development Tools

- **Linting**: Biome (via Ultracite)
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner
- **Documentation**: Fumadocs (Markdown-based)

## Development Workflow

### Common Commands

Run these from the project root:

```bash
# Start all services
bun dev

# Build all packages
bun run build

# Build specific package
bun run build --filter @cossistant/react

# Run linter and auto-fix issues
bun run fix

# Type check all packages
bun run check-types

# Check documentation links
bun run docs:links
```

### API-Specific Commands

Run these from `apps/api`:

```bash
# Start API server only
bun run dev

# Run migrations
bun run db:migrate

# Seed database
bun run db:seed

# Open Drizzle Studio
bun run db:studio

# Generate Better Auth schema
bun run better-auth:generate-schema
```

### Before Committing

Always run these commands before committing:

```bash
# Auto-fix linting issues
bun run fix

# Verify TypeScript types
bun run check-types

# Run tests (in relevant package)
cd packages/react
bun test
```

### Testing

Cossistant uses Bun's built-in test runner. Tests are colocated with source files using the `*.test.ts` naming convention.

```bash
# Run tests in a specific package
cd packages/react
bun test

# Watch mode
bun test --watch

# Coverage report
bun test --coverage
```

## Project Philosophy

Cossistant is built with these core principles:

### Code-First, Not Clicks

We prefer programmatic solutions over UI configuration. Our documentation includes code examples you can copy and paste, not screenshots of admin panels.

### API-First Design

Every feature is accessible via API before it gets a UI. This ensures flexibility and enables headless usage patterns.

### Headless Components

Our React components are unstyled and composable, giving you complete control over the look and feel while we handle the complex state management and real-time synchronization.

### TypeScript-First

Type safety isn't optional—it's built in from the ground up. This catches errors early and provides excellent IntelliSense in your editor.

### Developer Experience is Paramount

We optimize for developer happiness:

- Clear error messages
- Comprehensive documentation
- Fast build times
- Minimal configuration
- AI-friendly docs that are easy to search and reference

### Open & Transparent

Everything is in the open. Our development happens on GitHub, our roadmap is public, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Conventional Commits

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test updates

Example: `feat: add message reactions to timeline items`

### Pull Requests

```bash
bun run changeset
```

Follow the prompts to describe your changes. This will be used to generate changelogs and version bumps.
