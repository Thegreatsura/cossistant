Understanding how users interact with your support widget is crucial for improving their experience.

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Widget Open Rate**: How often users seek help
- **Resolution Rate**: Questions answered without escalation
- **Time to Resolution**: How quickly issues are resolved
- **User Satisfaction**: Post-interaction ratings

## Integrating with Popular Tools

<Support
  onEvent={(event) => {
    analytics.track(event.type, event.data);
  }}
