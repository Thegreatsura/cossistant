Your support widget should feel like a natural part of your application. Here's how to customize every aspect of the Cossistant widget.

## Theme Customization

Match your brand colors and typography:

```tsx
<Support
  theme={{
    primaryColor: "#6366f1",
    fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif",
    borderRadius: "12px",
  }}
/>
```

## Positioning

Control where the widget appears:

```tsx
<Support position="bottom-right" offset={{ x: 20, y: 20 }} />
```

## Custom Trigger

Use your own button instead of the default:

```tsx
<Support
  customTrigger={({ open }) => <button onClick={open}>Need help?</button>}
/>
```

## Controlled Mode

Take full control of the widget state:

```tsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

<Support open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen} />;
```

This is particularly useful when you want to:

- Open the widget programmatically
- Track widget interactions
- Integrate with your analytics
