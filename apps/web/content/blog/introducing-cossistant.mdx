Before writting this blog post, I was on X and this post stopped me in my tracks.

It's true, the code of your product has never been the value. The service is. **Software as a Service.** We say it all the time but we forget what it actually means.

And right now, something big is shifting.

## AI changes who can build

AI is democratizing software. The barrier to shipping a product has never been lower. Anyone with an idea and a weekend can launch something real.

This is incredible. It's also a problem.

When everyone can build, "I built something" stops being impressive. The question becomes: is it any good? Does it *work* for people? Do they stay?

The code isn't the moat anymore. The experience is.

## Smaller teams with bigger products

Here's what I see coming: smaller teams shipping products to more users than ever before. One engineer doing the work of ten. Three people running what used to need thirty.

AI handles the grunt work. Copilots write the boilerplate. Agents handle the repetitive tasks.

But there's a catch.

More users means more questions. More edge cases. More "how do I do this?" and "this doesn't work" and "can you help me with...?"

The bottleneck isn't code anymore. It's service. It's support.

## The support problem

I'm Anthony. I've been a software engineer for more than 10 years, messing around with code since I was twelve.

Yes, I'm starting to get some wrinkles on my forehead.

There's something I love deeply: building beautiful, polished SaaS. And one of the first things I do when building a new product is making sure I stay available at ANY time for my customers. Ready to answer their questions or help them on the spot when a bug arises — because we know it: there will be bugs.

Probably like you, I would turn to platforms like Intercom or my favorite, Crisp. I've been a user for many years.

But I feel like I've never had a platform truly made for me. For developers. For this moment.

## Generic support in a custom world

We're living in the age of shadcn. Open components. Open source. Complete control over every pixel of your product.

So why is support still a black box?

A widget that looks the same on every site. Configuration panels instead of code. AI that's bolted on, not built in. No way to extend it. No way to make it *yours*.

I'm a developer. In the age of AI, shadcn, and open source: **I WANT and NEED control.**

- I want the support to LOOK and FEEL like my product.
- I want the support to be IN my product. Maybe in a page? Modal? Sidebar?
- I want to code skills for my support AI agent.
- I simply want control.

## What I'm building

This is why I built Cossistant.

It's an open-source support widget for React. Think of it as the **shadcn of support**: a `<Support />` component you drop in, or headless primitives you compose however you want.

But the widget is just the surface. Here's the vision:

### Code-first AI agents and Human together

Your AI agent shouldn't be a configuration page. It should be code. Skills you write. Logic you control. Integrations you build.

The best support isn't AI replacing humans. It's AI and humans working in the same conversation. AI handles the first response, gathers context, answers what it can. Humans step in when it matters.

Not AI *or* human. AI *and* human.

AI should be a helper, not the main character. The human is always at the center of the support experience, your team and your customers. AI augments. AI accelerates. But humans connect.

This is what I believe. This is what I'm building.

## The future of support

Support is about to become a real differentiator. When everyone can ship, the ones who win are the ones who *serve*.

Generic widgets won't cut it. Black-box AI won't cut it. The future belongs to teams who craft support experiences as carefully as they craft their products.

Code-first. Human-centered. Fully yours.

This is Cossistant.
