Building great customer support doesn't have to be complicated. With Cossistant, you can add intelligent, AI-powered support to your application in minutes.

## Why AI-Powered Support?

Traditional support systems require constant human attention. AI support can:

- **Respond instantly** to common questions
- **Learn from your documentation** to provide accurate answers
- **Escalate intelligently** when human help is needed
- **Work 24/7** without breaks

## Quick Installation

Getting started is simple. Install the package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @cossistant/react
```

## Basic Setup

Add the support widget to your React application:

```tsx
import { Support } from "@cossistant/react";

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Application</h1>
      <Support />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! Your users now have access to AI-powered support.
