A well-trained AI assistant can handle the majority of support queries. Here's how to optimize yours.

## Content Sources

Cossistant learns from multiple sources:

- **Documentation**: Your main knowledge base
- **FAQ pages**: Common questions and answers
- **Help articles**: Step-by-step guides
- **Release notes**: Product updates and changes

## Writing for AI

### Be Specific

Instead of:

> "Configure the settings as needed"

Write:

> "Set `timeout` to 5000ms for optimal performance on standard connections"

### Use Consistent Terminology

Create a glossary and stick to it:

- ✅ "Support widget" (always)
- ❌ "Chat widget", "Help button", "Support popup"

### Structure Content

```markdown
## Feature Name

### What it does

Brief description...

### How to use it

Step-by-step instructions...

### Common issues

Troubleshooting guide...
```

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Review unanswered queries** weekly
2. **Update documentation** for gaps
3. **Monitor satisfaction scores** by topic
4. **A/B test response styles**
