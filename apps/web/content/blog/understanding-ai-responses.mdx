Cossistant uses advanced AI to provide accurate support responses. Understanding how it works helps you get the most out of it.

## How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Your docs are processed and indexed
2. **Context Retrieval**: Relevant sections are found for each query
3. **Response Generation**: AI crafts a natural response
4. **Citation Linking**: Sources are linked for verification

## Improving Response Quality

### Write Clear Documentation

The AI is only as good as your documentation. Write clear, structured content:

- Use descriptive headings
- Include code examples
- Cover common edge cases
- Keep information up to date

### Provide Context

Help the AI understand your product:

```tsx
<Support
  context={{
    product: "Cossistant",
    version: "2.0",
    environment: "production",
  }}
/>
```

## Handling Edge Cases

When the AI doesn't know an answer, it will:

1. Acknowledge the limitation honestly
2. Suggest related topics it can help with
3. Offer to connect with human support

This transparency builds user trust.
