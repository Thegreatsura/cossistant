## Widget

- **Conversation Visibility Tracking**: Added widget visibility tracking to the `useConversationAutoSeen` hook, ensuring conversations are only marked as seen when the support widget is actually open and visible to the visitor.
- **Message Handling Logic**: Updated message handling to mark conversations as seen only for users and AI agents, while improving visitor tracking with widget visibility checks for more accurate conversation state.
- **Navigation and History**: Improved navigation flow and conversation history logic for a smoother, more intuitive user experience.
- **Visitor Identification**: Enhanced the `IdentifySupportVisitor` component with better validation and error handling.
- **Closed Conversation Handling**: Disabled visitor replies on closed conversations, preventing confusion and maintaining conversation state integrity.
- **Unread Count**: Fixed unread count computation to accurately reflect unread messages in the widget badge.
- **Default Open Option**: Added support for configuring the widget to open by default on page load.
- **Prefetch Optimization**: Delayed support prefetch until website context is available, and improved prefetching of visitor conversations for accurate unread badge display.
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced error handling in `CossistantRestClient` and improved code formatting across provider and timeline components for better maintainability.
- **Widget Cleanup**: Removed unused features and code to reduce bundle size and improve performance.

## Dashboard

- **Inbox Improvements**: Enhanced inbox interface with better conversation list display and navigation.
- **Landing Page Animations**: Improved dashboard animation on the landing page with synchronized fake dashboard and conversation list for better demo experience.

## Documentation

- Fixed Tailwind CSS setup documentation and configuration examples.
- Improved release workflow documentation.
