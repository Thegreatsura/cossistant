# Progress Log: Tinybird Analytics Migration

## Session Started: 2026-02-11

### Phase 0: Research & Planning ✅

**Completed:**
- Explored current analytics implementation (7 PG queries, presence via Redis, visitor schema)
- Researched Tinybird: Events API, TTL, pricing, pipes, real-time, integration patterns
- Identified what stays (Redis presence, PG profiles/feedback) vs what moves (analytics events)
- Created findings.md with architecture decisions
- Creating task_plan.md with phased migration plan
